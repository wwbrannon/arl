o) import system: should we load everything by default as currently? need to update docs if this changes
o) "bare engine" -- implement?

o) import: actually need to update docs anyway, they say inconsistent things about how everything is loaded automatically and how you can load whatever you need
o) "load only the modules you need." is not true; lots of "import" we no longer need; should we require them?

o) avoid having examples use r/call so heavily
o) this para needs update: Inside a quasiquoted template, ,expr (unquote) evaluates expr and splices the result into the template,
o) "To expand only one level, use macroexpand-1 from Arl code:" also mention the R call
o) explain this better "Self-TCO only works with the define/lambda form" -- it requires a name
o) we don't optimize TCO in anonymous functions called recursively via combinators
o) the "Summary" table in the self-TCO vignette is transposed or otherwise confusing
o) "Arl also has dotted pairs" note these are not R's pairlist

o) move the badges into the footer

o) README.md: update
o) index.md: write a couple paragraphs including "Getting Started" and "Examples" up top
o) getting started: update

o) sanity-check the inst/examples
o) sanity-check the vignettes, just read the whole site

o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump?

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
