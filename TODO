o) do we need these math functions? they're very thin wrappers. and/or should they take variable arguments? more generally, there are many functions in the inst/rye files that are the thinest possible wrappers around R functions but add more complexity and another stack frame. can we drop them and add a long comment listing the functions provided by base R that we use? Or even just say (define log __rlog) to skip the needless lambda?
o) helper function callable from rye to add docstrings to an existing object, which we should then use for the direct assignments above

o) look at the test behavior: any tests that look obviously bad? anywhere it's not what a lisp should do? identify questionable choices that may reflect encoding bugs into tests

o) bench-eval and bench-e2e fail
o) "Failed" profiling section
o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) FIXME in tests about keyword arg syntax
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
