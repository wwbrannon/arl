o) read Getting Started, macro guide, module guide

o) substantive changes
    o) more future-proof import syntax a la python

    o) should we have stats and datasets on the search path? parent env choice
    (stats::lm (~ mpg cyl) :data datasets::mtcars)

    o) is opt-rest behaving correctly in macro vignette? probably yes: but it should be stated clearly that the optional parameters have to be passed with keyword args

o) this doesn't work in macro vignette, __case-clauses DNE
    (defmacro case (key clause . rest)
    (define key-sym (gensym "case-key"))
    `((lambda (,key-sym)
        ,(__case-clauses key-sym clause rest))
        ,key))

o) this is a bad example:
    Macros can also expand into calls to other macros. The expander recursively expands until no macro calls remain:

    ;; cond expands into nested if, which may contain further macro calls
    (cond
    ((= x 1) "one")
    ((= x 2) "two")
    (else "other"))

o) update macro vignette "rest parameters" and "defining macros" "yes" examples once print bug is fixed

o) what does this mean? "If omitted, the parser falls back to a (doc! ...) call."

o) the arl-vs-scheme vignette needs to talk about the macro differences

o) the "Non-standard evaluation" in r-interop.Rmd is confusing: uses r/eval but that's not discussed, need to discuss it

o) update the r-interop.Rmd vignette with fixes to rendering of lm and maybe search path

o) "R base operators are also available directly": this is a bad example because we wrap these to support > 2 args, note this and also give other examples

o) function vignette should explain what destructuring bind is or link to it

o) getting started: "It also falls through to R’s built-in help for R functions" isn't true?

words to write yourself
o) README: package does not include a citation file, revise wording, actually figure out the citation at all
o) top couple paras of Getting Started, README and index.md need updating
o) include links to getting started and examples at top of index.md
o) DESCRIPTION title and description
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump

o) run the test auditor and doc auditor again

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
