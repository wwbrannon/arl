o) improve variadic argument handling -- utilities?
o) we can do this with the test case of moving identical? over

o) fix 2 warnings in tests

o) we should change the equality system again: identical? doesn't need special handling and can be an alias; rather equal? should take a kwarg identical which says to use identical; otherwise it should use ==; or maybe kwarg strict or kwarg permissive

o) several circularities in the stdlib. equality for example should be in core

o) update the (license) function, should wrap it

o) look for and rewrite any tail recursive functions: we don't have TCO

o) FIXME in tests about keyword arg syntax

--------------------------------------
o) look at the test behavior: any tests that look obviously bad? anywhere it's not what a lisp should do? identify questionable choices that may reflect encoding bugs into tests

o) bench-eval and bench-e2e fail
o) "Failed" profiling section
o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) documentation updates / systematizing: make a plan

o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
