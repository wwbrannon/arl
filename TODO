coverage tracking:
-------------------------------------------------
o) address test gaps this reveals

o) generally sanity-check all of this, look at the coverage reports
o) make CI configuration for this and everything else sane, figure out how to run some more during Feb, maybe shrink matrix?
o) actually push this, get CI working

audits / comprehensive sanity checks:
-------------------------------------------------
o) have opus audit the tests again:
```
Take a look at the tests in tests/, maybe especially the native ones in
tests/native/. Keep in mind that the language being tested is supposed to be a
lisp, generally scheme-like, but implemented on top of R. So that makes for a
few peculiarities -- R's type system, no tail call optimization, the whole
"r/call" apparatus, etc.

Given that, let's critique these tests. Is there any behavior they implement
that they clearly shouldn't? Mistaken behavior of the interpreter we have now
that's been hardcoded into the tests? You're looking for things that clearly
don't make sense and aren't how an R-based lisp should behave. Use your
judgment!
```

o) have opus audit/critique the architecture and make performance-related suggestions:
```
Take a look at the architecture of this rye language implementation. We've made
several improvements to get better performance, especially implementing a
compiler in lieu of an AST-walking evaluator and adding disk-backed module
caching. And performance is indeed much better: the examples test suite has
gone from about 85s runtime to about 7.5s.

But let's think about other ways to improve performance. Low-hanging fruit is
especially desirable, but we should also think about larger architectural
choices. Are there other good options to get better time or space performance?
```

small stuff:
--------------------------------------
o) minor output formatting issues -- TRUE printed rather than #t for example

o) general code quality / duplication pass
o) run `make lint`, fix and/or update lint rules

o) run benchmarks / profiles again after all this, commit them

documentation updates:
-------------------------------------------------
o) update / systematize docs: make a plan
o) write a compiler vignette (or inst/doc file?)
o) internal technical docs in inst/doc
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
o) get the site and vignettes updated
o) actually push site somewhere
o) get make document working

# Execution Coverage Implementation Complete (2026-02-08)
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Implemented execution coverage tracking system:
# - RyeCoverageTracker class in R/coverage.R (~460 lines)
# - Runtime hooks in eval_compiled() for tracking
# - Simplified tools/rye-coverage.R to thin wrapper (~120 lines)
# - Tracker created BEFORE engine init to track stdlib loading
# - Test files excluded from coverage (only stdlib tracked)
# - All reports (console, HTML, JSON) working correctly
# - CI integration unchanged and working
# - Coverage: 91.7% (2,529/2,758 lines) - accurate execution tracking
# - See inst/doc/EXECUTION_COVERAGE.md for complete documentation
