o) read Getting Started, macro guide, module guide

o) substantive changes
    o) should we have stats and datasets on the search path -- `(stats::lm (~ mpg cyl) :data datasets::mtcars)` is annoying to type? comes down to the choice of parent env: baseenv vs globalenv
    o) probably switch this example to eval=TRUE and fix it / its asserts up

    o) more future-proof import syntax a la python

o) eval_string alias for eval_text

o) update macro vignette "rest parameters" and "defining macros" "yes" examples once print bug is fixed

o) what does this mean? "If omitted, the parser falls back to a (doc! ...) call."

o) update the r-interop.Rmd vignette with fixes to rendering of lm and maybe search path

o) "R base operators are also available directly": this is a bad example because we wrap these to support > 2 args, note this and also give other examples

o) getting started: "It also falls through to R’s built-in help for R functions" isn't true?

words to write yourself
o) README: package does not include a citation file, revise wording, actually figure out the citation at all
o) top couple paras of Getting Started, README and index.md need updating
o) include links to getting started and examples at top of index.md
o) DESCRIPTION title and description
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump

o) run the test auditor and doc auditor again

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
