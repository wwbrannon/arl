o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) Look for any R code that’s left over or not used
o) Look for any R code that can be refactored to make it simpler

o) How to calculate test coverage of .rye code

o) More tests for .rye code

o) remove translate R api

o) translate doesn't correctly backtick-quote bad idents

o) help.R should be integrated into OO classes somehow

o) too many functions left around being called from these new classes that implement basically all functionality, defeats the purpose
o) functions like rye_parse should not refer to a default env, that entangles evaluation with a different engine instance
o) do we still need the globals.R file?
o) this default engine stuff is bad, certainly when used in these functions internally

o) the cli, repl might benefit from oo refactoring
