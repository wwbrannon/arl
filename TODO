o) does this actually work with R version 3.0?

Import and interop fixes:
    o) how to load rye-lang stdlib files in the repl? e.g. inst/rye/prelude.rye
    o) can we make those available to R code as well?
    o) do we need anywhere to have any special handling of .rye the file ending?

big features:
    o) what else needs to be in the stdlib? other common lisp features
    o) more tests; big integration-type tests?
    o) better docs?

inst/CITATION?
