o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking
    o) we should probably take out full call/cc and just use R's downward-only
    o) tail-call optimization (will also fix failing profile case)
    o) use R's bytecode compiler
    o) other things

o) update the examples vignette to dynamically pull in the examples

o) should the macro and module registries really be user-visible variables?

o) Can we rewrite any of the current code in rye? Any functionality that can be streamlined?
* Stdlib

o) Look for any R code that’s left over or not used

o) Look for any R code that can be refactored to make it simpler

o) How to calculate test coverage of .rye code

o) More tests for .rye code
