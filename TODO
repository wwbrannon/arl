o) what else in base R has this sort of substitute behavior as suppressWarnings that we need to macro-wrap?

o) &optional or similar syntax for lambda
o) can macros have docstrings?
o) replace while-r and for-r with appropriate handling of loops in the evaluator?
o) for* and while* absolutely should not be tail recursive if they are
o) loop macro is wildly overcomplicated. factor it out?

o) we should change the equality system again: identical? doesn't need special handling and can be an alias; rather equal? should take a kwarg identical which says to use identical; otherwise it should use ==; or maybe kwarg strict or kwarg permissive

o) FIXME in tests about keyword arg syntax

o) several circularities in the stdlib. equality for example should be in core

--------------------------------------
o) look at the test behavior: any tests that look obviously bad? anywhere it's not what a lisp should do? identify questionable choices that may reflect encoding bugs into tests

o) bench-eval and bench-e2e fail
o) "Failed" profiling section
o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) documentation updates / systematizing: make a plan

o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
