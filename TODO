o) clean up what in the stdlib is loaded by default
o) any core functions hy or other lisps have that we're missing? any really obvious additions?
    o) anything that's added should be added in phases
    o) each phase: first, add tests,nformed by what's common in lisps (with adaptations to R as needed),  then add code to verify against the tests
o) look at the test behavior: any tests that look obviously bad? anywhere it's not what a lisp should do? identify questionable choices that may reflect encoding bugs into tests

o) bench-eval and bench-e2e fail
o) "Failed" profiling section
o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) FIXME in tests about keyword arg syntax
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
