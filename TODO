  Low-Hanging Optimization Opportunities

  1. sugar_map in parser — hoist to module-level constant (allocated once instead of thousands of times)
  2. .classify_atom grepl cascade — replace with single-char checks or a single combined regex
  3. Per-token named list allocation — could use a column-oriented representation (parallel vectors of types, values, lines, cols) instead of list-of-lists
  4. contains_macro_head walk — could be skipped when macro cache is empty (already happens, but strip_src still walks the tree)
  5. O(n^2) top-level expression append — preallocate or use chunked collection like s-expr parsing does
  6. try_constant_fold whitelist — use an environment for O(1) lookup instead of %in%

o) get car/cdr cons at the top of the list-seq vignette

---

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running

o) review all the docs

words to write yourself
o) figure out citation
o) top couple paras of Getting Started, README and index.md need updating
o) DESCRIPTION title and description

o) logo?

o) figure out how to host the docs

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
