o) just read the whole doc site and make edits
    o) avoid having examples use r/call so heavily
    o) this para needs update: Inside a quasiquoted template, ,expr (unquote) evaluates expr and splices the result into the template,
    o) "To expand only one level, use macroexpand-1 from Arl code:" also mention the R call
    o) explain this better "Self-TCO only works with the define/lambda form" -- it requires a name
    o) we don't optimize TCO in anonymous functions called recursively via combinators
    o) the "Summary" table in the self-TCO vignette is transposed or otherwise confusing
    o) "Arl also has dotted pairs" note these are not R's pairlist
    o) sanity-check the inst/examples

o) README.md: update
o) index.md: write a couple paragraphs including "Getting Started" and "Examples" up top
o) getting started: update
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
