o) reorganize stdlib vignettes and underlying modules

o) do we test well enough that call/cc works?

o) does this break things?
Env var	Description
ARL_SKIP_USER_PROFILE	Skip sourcing ~/.Rprofile when launching the CLI

o) this is not silent, but the env var version just below does work:
options(arl.quiet = TRUE)
engine <- arl::Engine$new()
engine$eval_text('(display "this is silent")')  # no output

o) just read the whole doc site and make edits
    o) this para needs update: Inside a quasiquoted template, ,expr (unquote) evaluates expr and splices the result into the template,
    o) "To expand only one level, use macroexpand-1 from Arl code:" also mention the R call
    o) explain this better "Self-TCO only works with the define/lambda form" -- it requires a name
    o) we don't optimize TCO in anonymous functions called recursively via combinators
    o) the "Summary" table in the self-TCO vignette is transposed or otherwise confusing
    o) "Arl also has dotted pairs" note these are not R's pairlist
    o) "It also falls through to R’s built-in help for R functions."

words to write yourself
o) README: package does not include a citation file, revise wording, actually figure out the citation at all
o) top couple paras of Getting Started, README and index.md need updating
o) include links to getting started and examples at top of index.md
o) DESCRIPTION title and description
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
