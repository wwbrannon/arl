o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking

o) Look for any R code that’s left over or not used
o) Look for any R code that can be refactored to make it simpler

o) How to calculate test coverage of .rye code

o) More tests for .rye code

rye> translate-str
Error: cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type 'character'

o) remove translate R api

o) translate doesn't correctly backtick-quote bad idents

o) too many functions left around being called from these new classes that implement basically all functionality, defeats the purpose

o) the cli, repl, help might benefit from oo refactoring

o) functions like rye_parse should not refer to a default env, that entangles evaluation with a different engine instance
o) rather the rye_load_stdlib function should become a method of one of the classes
o) gensym should also be local to the macroexpander for closely related reasons, right now it's package-global state and doesn't behave reasonably in the context of multiple engine instances
o) do we still need the globals.R file?
o) split new classes into multiple files
o) this default engine stuff is bad, certainly when used in these functions internally
