o) read module guide

o) substantive changes
    o) should we have stats and datasets on the search path -- `(stats::lm (~ mpg cyl) :data datasets::mtcars)` is annoying to type? comes down to the choice of parent env: baseenv vs globalenv
    o) probably switch this example to eval=TRUE and fix it / its asserts up
    o) update the r-interop.Rmd vignette with fixes to rendering of lm and maybe search path

    o) more future-proof import syntax a la python

    o) let's have a load-stdlib command

    o) fallthrough to R's help for R functions doesn't work

o) macro vignette should mention macroexpansion depth argument

o) docs should discuss dotted pair lists in detail somewhere
o) in "Lists and quoting" section of getting started, just link to another discussion of them

o) execute the R snippets in getting-started where possible

o) update the silent asserts in getting-started, we've made some changes and coverage is now worse

o) the module system seems to decide what a module is called based on its filename

o) discuss in getting started how this is confusing:
    arl> (list? '(1 2 3))
    TRUE
    arl> (is.list '(1 2 3))
    FALSE

o) what does this mean? "If omitted, the parser falls back to a (doc! ...) call."

o) "R base operators are also available directly": this is a bad example because we wrap these to support > 2 args, note this and also give other examples

o) is this true? "The import form is primarily useful inside your own modules (which start with an empty scope)"
o) closely related: scope here doesn't seem to be lexical:
    will@macbook:~/github/arl$ cat mybinding.arl
    (module mybinding
        (export mylet)

        (defmacro mylet (bindings . body)
        (if (null? bindings)
            `(begin ,@body)
            (begin
            (define temps (map (lambda (b) (gensym "tmp")) bindings))
            (define patterns (map car bindings))
            (define values (map (lambda (b) (car (cdr b))) bindings))
            `((lambda ,temps
                ,@(map (lambda (pair)
                        `(define ,(car pair) ,(car (cdr pair))))
                        (zip patterns temps))
                (begin ,@body))
                ,@values))))
    )

o) run the test auditor and doc auditor again

words to write yourself
o) README: package does not include a citation file, revise wording, actually figure out the citation at all
o) top couple paras of Getting Started, README and index.md need updating
o) include links to getting started and examples at top of index.md
o) DESCRIPTION title and description
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
