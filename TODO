o) self-TCO?
Does NOT handle (v1 limitations):
- Mutual recursion, let/letrec body tail calls (they expand to IIFEs — nested lambdas), rest params (...), destructuring params, keyword args in self-calls

o) `make coverage` doesn't write the R coverage outputs by file to summary.txt
o) do we really have 100% coverage for all rye code?

smaller stuff:
--------------------------------------
o) minor output formatting issues -- TRUE printed rather than #t for example

o) general code quality / duplication pass
o) run `make lint`, fix and/or update lint rules

o) run benchmarks / profiles again after all this, commit them

o) make CI configuration for coverage and everything else sane, figure out how to run some more during Feb, maybe shrink matrix?
o) enable actions, get CI working

documentation updates:
-------------------------------------------------
o) update / systematize docs: make a plan
o) write a compiler vignette (or inst/doc file?)
o) internal technical docs in inst/doc
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
o) get the site and vignettes updated
o) actually push site somewhere
o) get make document working
