o) "predicates" is not a really coherent thing to have a file of, we should prob split these up

performance issues:
-------------------------------------------------
o) have opus or some such critique the architecture and make suggestions

test audits:
-------------------------------------------------
o) expand test coverage for newer components

o) audit for test duplication and remove it, especially between native and stdlib-*

o) have opus audit the tests again:
```
Take a look at the tests in tests/, maybe especially the native ones in
tests/native/. Keep in mind that the language being tested is supposed to be a
lisp, generally scheme-like, but implemented on top of R. So that makes for a
few peculiarities -- R's type system, no tail call optimization, the whole
"r/call" apparatus, etc.

Given that, let's critique these tests. Is there any behavior they implement
that they clearly shouldn't? Mistaken behavior of the interpreter we have now
that's been hardcoded into the tests? You're looking for things that clearly
don't make sense and aren't how an R-based lisp should behave. Use your
judgment!
```
or similar

small stuff:
--------------------------------------
o) general code quality / duplication pass

o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
o) run lints and fix

documentation updates:
-------------------------------------------------
o) update / systematize docs: make a plan
o) write a compiler vignette
