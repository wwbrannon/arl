o) refactor stdlib into different files, especially -core is too big

o) Loading in R/stdlib.R: we don't need an express list right? use import
o) refactor these stdlib files to use (module ...)

o) Can we rewrite any of the current code in rye? Any functionality that can be streamlined?
* Stdlib
* formatting/printing
* Destructuring utilities

o) Look for any R code that’s left over or not used

o) Look for any R code that can be refactored to make it simpler

o) How to calculate test coverage of .rye code

o) More tests for .rye code
