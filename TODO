o) the coverage/rye/summary.txt file produced by `make coverage` says we have 100% coverage of all rye code, which I'm sure is wrong. can you take a look?

o) run the test auditor agent again on the whole codebase

smaller stuff:
--------------------------------------
o) general code quality / duplication pass
o) run `make lint`, fix and/or update lint rules

o) run benchmarks / profiles again after all this, commit them

o) make CI configuration for coverage and everything else sane, figure out how to run some more during Feb, maybe shrink matrix?
o) enable actions, get CI working

documentation updates:
-------------------------------------------------
o) update / systematize docs: make a plan
o) write a compiler vignette (or inst/doc file?)
o) internal technical docs in inst/doc
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
o) get the site and vignettes updated
o) actually push site somewhere
o) get make document working
