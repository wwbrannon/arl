o) there's a tail recursive pattern in ==! eliminate any tail recursion. update AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md to say this
o) fix while* and for*

--------------------------------------
o) look at the test behavior: any tests that look obviously bad? anywhere it's not what a lisp should do? identify questionable choices that may reflect encoding bugs into tests

o) this stdlib is very poorly organized, has undocumented dependencies on prior import order, needs to be refactored
o) several circularities in the stdlib. equality for example should be in core

o) performance optimizations: use profiling and benchmarking
    o) the evaluator is too dynamic and creates way too many stack frames per rye call. this is presumably the main performance bottleneck

o) documentation updates / systematizing: make a plan

--------------------------------------
small stuff:
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
o) recursion-related FIXMEs (reenable some code) in benchmarks after evaluator improvements
