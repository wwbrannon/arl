o) vignettes code should be executable / executed during build where possible

o) systematically look through the docs and find mismatches with code or with other docs

o) rename "stdlib-env"?
o) do we need r/call? (yes, probably) can we take it out of the examples?
o) import system: should we load everything by default as currently? need to update docs if this changes
o) actually need to update docs anyway, they say inconsistent things about how everything is loaded automatically and how you can load whatever you need

o) break up examples page? is this a good idea?

o) "load only the modules you need." is not true; lots of "import" we no longer need; should we require them?
o) "To expand only one level, use macroexpand-1 from Arl code:" also mention the R call
o) explain this better "Self-TCO only works with the define/lambda form" -- it requires a name
o) we don't optimize TCO in anonymous functions called recursively via combinators
o) the "Summary" table in the self-TCO vignette is transposed or otherwise confusing
o) "Arl also has dotted pairs" note these are not R's pairlist

o) move the badges into the footer

o) README.md: update
o) index.md: write a couple paragraphs including "Getting Started" and "Examples" up top
o) sanity-check the inst/examples
o) sanity-check the vignettes, just read the whole site
o) logo?

o) enable actions / get non-pkgdown workflows running
o) figure out how to host the docs
o) version number bump?

o) run other cran submission steps and submit
