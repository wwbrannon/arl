tests and related fixes:
-------------------------------------------------
o) could we build instrumented coverage tooling for .rye files easily via covr? we do actually have a compiler to R now...

o) have opus audit the tests again:
```
Take a look at the tests in tests/, maybe especially the native ones in
tests/native/. Keep in mind that the language being tested is supposed to be a
lisp, generally scheme-like, but implemented on top of R. So that makes for a
few peculiarities -- R's type system, no tail call optimization, the whole
"r/call" apparatus, etc.

Given that, let's critique these tests. Is there any behavior they implement
that they clearly shouldn't? Mistaken behavior of the interpreter we have now
that's been hardcoded into the tests? You're looking for things that clearly
don't make sense and aren't how an R-based lisp should behave. Use your
judgment!
```

performance audit:
-------------------------------------------------
o) have opus audit/critique the architecture and make performance-related suggestions:
```
Take a look at the architecture of this rye language implementation. We've made
several improvements to get better performance, especially implementing a
compiler in lieu of an AST-walking evaluator and adding disk-backed module
caching. And performance is indeed much better: the examples test suite has
gone from about 85s runtime to about 7.5s.

But let's think about other ways to improve performance. Low-hanging fruit is
especially desirable, but we should also think about larger architectural
choices. Are there other good options to get better time or space performance?
```

small stuff:
--------------------------------------
o) minor output formatting issues -- TRUE printed rather than #t for example

o) general code quality / duplication pass
o) run `make lint`, fix and/or update lint rules

o) run the benchmarks and profiles again after all this, commit them

documentation updates:
-------------------------------------------------
o) update / systematize docs: make a plan
o) write a compiler vignette (or inst/doc file?)
o) internal technical docs in inst/doc
o) minor pkgdown warning about site url
