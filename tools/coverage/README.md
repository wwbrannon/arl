# Coverage Tools

Coverage tracking for both R implementation code and Arl language code. Reports are generated in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, XML) and integrated with CI/CD.

## arl-coverage.R

Code coverage analysis tool for .arl source files.

### Overview

Tracks which lines of .arl source files are compiled and generates coverage reports. Unlike traditional code coverage tools that only work with the implementation language (R), this tool reports on the actual Arl source files in the standard library (`inst/arl/*.arl`) and native tests (`tests/native/*.arl`).

**Coverage Metric:** Currently tracks *compilation coverage* - lines that can be successfully compiled. This is a conservative metric that shows which code is syntactically valid and reachable by the compiler.

### Usage

Run via Make:

```bash
make coverage
```

Or directly from R:

```r
source('tools/coverage/arl-coverage.R')

# Console report only
arl_coverage_report(output = "console")

# Console + HTML report
arl_coverage_report(output = c("console", "html"))

# Custom HTML output location
arl_coverage_report(
  output = c("console", "html"),
  html_file = "coverage-arl/index.html"
)
```

### Output

**Console Report:**
- Per-file coverage summary with percentages
- Total coverage across all .arl files
- Example output:
  ```
  Arl Code Coverage Report (Compilation Coverage)
  ===============================================

  assert.arl                                 65/  58 lines (112.1%)
  core.arl                                   98/  84 lines (116.7%)
  ...

  Total: 3568/3774 lines (94.5%)
  ```

**HTML Report** (`coverage-arl/index.html`):
- Interactive report with file summary table
- Line-by-line coverage view for each file
- Color-coded lines:
  - Green: covered (compiled)
  - Red: uncovered (not compiled)
  - Gray: empty lines / comments
- Clickable table of contents

### How It Works

1. **Discovery:** Finds all `.arl` files in `inst/arl/` and `tests/native/`

2. **Compilation:** Compiles each file using the Arl compiler, which attaches `arl_src` attributes to compiled R expressions containing source location metadata

3. **Extraction:** Recursively walks compiled expression trees to extract all `arl_src` attributes

4. **Reporting:** Maps source locations back to original .arl files and generates coverage metrics

### Coverage >100%?

You may notice some files show >100% coverage. This occurs because:
- Multi-line expressions mark ALL lines in their range as covered
- A single source line may participate in multiple compiled expressions
- This is conservative (better to over-report than under-report)

### Limitations

- **Compilation coverage only:** Currently tracks which lines *can be compiled*, not which lines *actually execute* during tests
- **Macro-generated code:** Code generated by macros is attributed to the macro call site
- **Standalone compilation:** Some test files may fail to compile standalone if they have circular dependencies with other modules

### Future Improvements

- Track execution coverage using runtime instrumentation (trace actual eval calls)
- Coverage history tracking
- Per-function coverage metrics

## coverage-combine.R

Combined coverage report generator that merges R and Arl coverage into unified reports.

### Overview

Creates comprehensive coverage summaries that show both R implementation coverage (from `covr`) and Arl language coverage (from `arl-coverage.R`) in a single view.

### Usage

Run via Make:

```bash
# Generate combined report (after running coverage-r and coverage-arl)
make coverage-combined

# Or run all coverage at once
make coverage
```

Or directly from R:

```r
source('tools/coverage/coverage-combine.R')
generate_combined_report()
```

### Output

**HTML Dashboard** (`coverage/combined/index.html`):
- Side-by-side coverage cards for R and Arl code
- Color-coded percentages (green ≥80%, orange ≥60%, red <60%)
- Links to detailed per-language reports
- Overall summary table with targets and status

**Markdown Summary** (`coverage/combined/COVERAGE.md`):
- Concise text summary suitable for PR comments
- Coverage percentages with target comparisons
- Status indicators (✅/⚠️)
- Links to HTML reports

### Configuration

Coverage thresholds and settings are defined in `codecov.yml`:
- R code target: 80%
- Arl code target: 85%
- Output directories and formats
- Exclusion patterns

## Coverage Infrastructure Overview

### Local Usage

```bash
# Run all coverage (recommended)
make coverage

# Run R coverage only
make coverage-r

# Run Arl coverage only
make coverage-arl

# Generate combined report
make coverage-combined

# Open reports in browser
make coverage-report

# Clean coverage outputs
make coverage-clean
```

### CI Integration

Coverage runs automatically on:
- Push to `main` branch
- All pull requests

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yaml`):
1. Runs both R and Arl coverage
2. Uploads results to Codecov with separate flags
3. Saves HTML reports as artifacts
4. Posts coverage summary as PR comment

### Codecov Integration

Coverage is tracked on [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) with:
- **Separate flags**: `r-code` and `arl-code`
- **Component tracking**: Compiler, Runtime, Parser, Stdlib modules
- **Thresholds**: R≥80%, Arl≥85%
- **PR comments**: Automatic coverage diff on pull requests

View configuration in `codecov.yml`.

All `coverage/` contents are git-ignored except `.gitkeep`.
